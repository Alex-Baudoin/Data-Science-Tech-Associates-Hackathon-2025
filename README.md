This work was done for the purpose of the Data Science Tech Associates Hackathon organized by the Rwanda ICT Chamber.

The project description can be found below: 

Rwanda has recently shifted towards a distance-based fare pricing model in public transport, replacing flat-rate fares. While intended to create a fairer and more sustainable transport system, the change has sparked varied reactions from the public across social media, forums, and other communication channels.

Design a solution that helps policymakers understand how citizens feel about the introduction of the distance-based fare system. Participants should explore ways to extract, process, and analyze public sentiment from diverse data sources (e.g., social media, news comments, survey data). The goal is to surface actionable insights that reveal public perception trends, key concerns, and potential misinformation.

Expected Outcome:

A dashboard, report, or visualization that summarizes sentiments over time and provides recommendations or flags issues for further investigation. Participants are free to define the approach, data sources, and tools to use.
