# Data-Science-Tech-Associates-Hackathon-2025
This work was done for the purpose of the Data Science Tech Associates Hackathon organized by the Rwanda ICT Chamber.


## Project Description

Rwanda has recently shifted towards a distance-based fare pricing model in public transport, replacing flat-rate fares. While intended to create a fairer and more sustainable transport system, the change has sparked varied reactions from the public across social media, forums, and other communication channels.

Design a solution that helps policymakers understand how citizens feel about the introduction of the distance-based fare system. Participants should explore ways to extract, process, and analyze public sentiment from diverse data sources (e.g., social media, news comments, survey data). The goal is to surface actionable insights that reveal public perception trends, key concerns, and potential misinformation.

Expected Outcome:

A dashboard, report, or visualization that summarizes sentiments over time and provides recommendations or flags issues for further investigation. Participants are free to define the approach, data sources, and tools to use.

Input Format

Use a framework that best showcases your skills.

Constraints

Plagiarism is prohibited
No heavy dependence on AI

##  Project structure
This work is divided in two parts. The first part which is a notebook titled "Sentiment_Analysis_Hackathon_2025" shows the different steps of data scraping, data preprocessing, visualizations techniques and detailed interpretation of those visualizations (report). The pictures are saves using the "save.fig()" command of python to create a comprehensive dashboard.

The second part is the notebook titled "sentiment-analysis-hackathon-2025-part2" is for toping modeling using the BERTopic library. We use several tools to capture the general topic associated with our dataset and trying to find whether or not the model is well trained with sufficient data. We use different techniques to visualize the top word scores (c-TF-IDF), the intertopic distance map and evaluate the similarity in between different topics. The results are satisfying because it uncovers the main themes in public reactions to Rwanda's shift to distance-based public transport fares. Visualizations' description serve as report here. 

Finally, images might not display here on Github, so the reader is advised to download the notebooks and run them locally or on Kaggle.
